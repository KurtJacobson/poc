Python OCE Composer (poc)
=========================

*poc* is a tool in the vein of *OpenSCAD* for creating 3D models in a high
level language with a minimum of boilerplate.

*poc* programs are Python3 programs, executed in an environment that
provides convenient shorthand for performing geometric operations.

*poc* uses OpenCASCADE (via occmodel) to implement its geometric operations.
This means it has different strengths and weaknesses compared to *OpenSCAD*,
which uses CGAL.  For instance, OpenCASCADE has `fillet` as a first-class
operation, while it lacks `minkowski` and `hull` which are quite frequently
used in *OpenSCAD*.

The the design of the *poc* standard library is very much in flux, and
there are likely to be compatibility-breaking changes as it develops.
